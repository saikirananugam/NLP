In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.",4,4,,

More reliable Systems

In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.",5,5,,

Complicated Operating System Required

There are multiple processors in a multiprocessor system that share peripherals, memory etc. So, it is much more complicated to schedule processes and impart resources to processes.than in single processor systems.

2,"There are multiple advantages to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are ?

More reliable Systems

In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.",5,5,,

3,"There are multiple advantages to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are Ÿ??

More reliable Systems

In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.

Disadvantages of Multiprocessor Systems
There are some disadvantages as well to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are:

Increased Expense

Even though multiprocessor systems are cheaper in the long run than using multiple computer systems, still they are quite expensive. It is much cheaper to buy a simple single processor system than a multiprocessor system.

Complicated Operating System Required

There are multiple processors in a multiprocessor system that share peripherals, memory etc. So, it is much more complicated to schedule processes and impart resources to processes.than in single processor systems. Hence, a more complex and complicated operating system is required in multiprocessor systems.

Large Main Memory Required

All the processors in the multiprocessor system share the memory. So a much larger pool of memory is required as compared to single processor systems.",0,0,,

COOPERATION AND PREEMPTION
Multitasking OSs can take a variety of forms. One difference is the way in which they handle the context switch between different users and tasks. A multitasking OS must have some way of deciding when is the appropriate time to make a context switch. The switch requires processing resources in order to be correctly executed, and switching contexts at random would reduce the system's predictability and efficiency over time. One method of deciding the timing of context switching is cooperative multitasking. With this method, the OS will not interrupt a process with a context switch while the process is running but will instead wait for the process to finish.",3,3,,

4,"Multitasking is a logical extension of multi programming. But multi programming works solely on the concept of context switching whereas multitasking is based on time sharing alongside the concept of context switching

- In a time sharing system, each process is assigned some specific quantum of time for which a process is meant to execute. Say there are 4 processes P1, P2, P3, P4 ready to execute. So each of them are assigned some time quantum for which they will execute e.g time quantum of 5 nanoseconds (5 ns). As one process begins execution (say P2), it executes for that quantum of time (5 ns). After 5 ns the CPU starts the execution of the other process (say P3) for the specified quantum of time.

- Thus the CPU makes the processes to share time slices between them and execute 
   accordingly. As soon as time quantum of one process expires, another process begins its 
   execution.

- Here also basically a context switch is occurring but it is occurring so fast that the user is 
  able to interact with each program separately while it is running. This way, the user is given 
  the illusion that multiple processes/ tasks are executing simultaneously. But actually only 
  one process/ task is executing at a particular instant of time. In multitasking, time sharing 
  is best manifested because each running process takes only a fair quantum of the CPU

New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units  and main memory. Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This ""context switch"" may be initiated at fixed time intervals (pre-emptive multitasking), or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (cooperative multitasking).",4,4,,

A processor that has more than one core is called Multicore Processor while one with single core is called Unicore Processor or Uniprocessor. Nowadays, most of systems have four cores (Quad-core) or eight cores (Octa-core). These cores can individually read and execute program instructions, giving feel like computer system has several processors but in reality, they are cores and not processors.

It is easier to design a single processor system as compared to a multiprocessor system. This is because all the processors in the multiprocessor system need to be synchronized and this can be quite complicated.
Throughput of a multiprocessor system is more than a single processor system. However, if the throughput of n single processor systems is T then the throughput of n processor multiprocessor system will be less than T.
Single processor systems are less reliable than multiprocessor systems because if the processor fails for some reason then system cannot work. In multiprocessor systems, even if one processor fails than the rest of the processors can pick up the slack. At most the throughput of the system decreases a little.
Most modern personal computers are single processor systems while multiprocessors are used in niche systems only.",5,5,,
